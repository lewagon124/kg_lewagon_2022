numToString function (Javascript function)

The numToString function was created to intake an array of integers from the user and change those same numbers into
string representation of the given digits.

An example of this would be an array of [3, 25, 209] which after processing through the function should result in the following:
Three,TwoFive,TwoZeroNine.
